HELLO WORLD!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## 1. Try Pushing Again

Run this command in your terminal:
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 2. What to Expect

- **If you’re not authenticated:**  
  Git will prompt you to log in to GitHub.  
  - If it asks for a username and password, you need to use a **personal access token** (not your GitHub password).
  - If a browser window opens, follow the instructions to authorize.

- **If you have 2FA enabled:**  
  You must use a personal access token as your password.

## 3. If You Need a Personal Access Token

1. Go to: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token"** (classic).
3. Give it a name, select `repo` scope, and generate.
4. Copy the token (you won’t see it again).
5. When prompted for a password in the terminal, paste the token.

## 4. If You Get Stuck

- Let me know exactly what you see in the terminal (any error messages or prompts).
- If you’re asked for a code on another device, check your email, phone, or GitHub app for a notification.
