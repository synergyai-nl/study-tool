# AI Instructions: Blog Writing & Storytelling Guidelines

## Canonical Approach

Whenever writing a blog post (or related content) for this project, follow these principles:

1. **Continuous Storytelling:**
   - Each post should contribute to an ongoing story of building, learning, and experimenting.
   - Share the journey, including motivations, challenges, and realizations.

2. **Checklist-Driven Progress (When Relevant):**
   - Use explicit checklists or bullet points to highlight concrete accomplishments, tasks, or milestones.
   - These lists should support the story, not replace it—always tie them back to the narrative.

3. **Narrative First:**
   - Even when using checklists, ensure there is a clear narrative thread. Explain why tasks matter, what was learned, and how each step fits into the bigger picture.
   - The story is about growth, discovery, and the process—not just the outcomes.

4. **Motivational and Accessible:**
   - Write in a way that encourages and empowers readers, especially those who may feel they "aren't technical enough."
   - Emphasize that tools like Cursor enable rapid progress, even without deep expertise.

5. **Explicit Attribution:**
   - If the post is AI-assisted, include a note about AI authorship and how readers can provide feedback.

6. **Formatting and Engagement:**
   - Use headings, lists, and clear formatting for readability.
   - Add images, captions, or other media if publishing online.
   - End with a call to action, teaser, or invitation for feedback.

7. **Consistency:**
   - The online version of the blog is the single source of truth for style and structure. Ignore the local version for future writing.
   - Adapt the tone and structure as the story evolves, but always maintain a blend of narrative and checklist-driven progress.
