# Day 1: Getting Stuff Done (with Cursor) — Even If You Don’t Know How It All Works

Today was wild. I started with nothing — literally, an empty repo and a blank README (not even cursor). Two hours later, I have a working foundation for my Study Tool, and I barely touched the docs or got lost in the weeds. Here’s how it went down, what I built, and why I’m honestly blown away by how much you can do (even if you don’t understand all the details).

## The Goal
I want to learn smarter, capture ideas as I read or listen, and have a constant flow of insights at the right moment. That’s the vision for my Study Tool.

## What I Did in 2 Hours

### 1. Set the Vision
- Cleaned up the README and put my learning vision front and center.

### 2. Connected Linear (task management) and Cursor (AI coding)
- Pulled in my Linear issues and projects so I could work in a focused, organized way.

### 3. Shaped the First User Story
- Wrote a ticket: “As a user, I want to add a learning entry (note, highlight, or idea) so I can start building my personal knowledge base.”

### 4. Built the Core Feature
- Created a form on the homepage to add new entries (notes, highlights, ideas).
- Hooked it up to Supabase so entries are saved and persist after a refresh.
- Displayed all entries in a nice table below the form.

### 5. Power User Hotkeys (because I love speed)
- Added keyboard shortcuts:
  - `n` focuses the entry form
  - `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter` submits the form
  - `?` or `Shift+/` shows a hotkey help dialog
  - `Esc` closes the help dialog

### 6. Tracked Everything in Linear
- Every step, every feature, every checkmark — all tracked and updated in Linear.

## The Big Realization
I got a LOT done, really quickly. And here’s the crazy part: I don’t fully understand what’s going on under the hood. Cursor (the AI coding assistant) handled the details, wrote the code, and even updated my tickets. I just focused on what I wanted to build and kept moving forward.

That’s insane. It means you don’t have to be a deep expert to ship real features, fast. You just need the right tools and a clear goal.

## High-Level Steps (So You Can Do It Too)
1. Set your vision and clean up your README.
2. Connect your project management (Linear) and coding tools (Cursor).
3. Write a clear, valuable first user story.
4. Build the smallest version of your core feature.
5. Add power user touches (like hotkeys) to make it fun.
6. Track your progress and check off your wins.

**That’s it for Day 1.**

If you’re reading this and thinking, “I could never build something like that,” trust me — you can. With tools like Cursor, you can get stuff done, even if you don’t know all the details. And that’s honestly the most exciting part of this journey.

Stay tuned for Day 2!
